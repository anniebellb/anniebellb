## Hiya ♡

How lovely of you to stop by — truly, what a treat.

I’m a Learning Experience Designer crafting wicked experiences & products. From transformative learning journeys to the fine art of *vibe coding*, I dabble in all things research & beautifully designed. Currently teaching myself to bring pixels to life and occasionally speaking fluent Figma. Stick around for side projects, accidental breakthroughs, & the occasional moment of brilliance.
